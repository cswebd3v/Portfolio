	<h1>About Chris</h1>
	<div class="bio">
		<p>Web development chose me. <br><br>It feels like Iâ€™ve dipped my toes into every career pool, but nothing clicked with me until I started coding. The thrill of writing code that works, the liberty of applying my own creative touch, the premise of a career where you are ALWAYS improving and learning-- I just love every bit of it.

		I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Bootcamp at Thinkful, where I am pushing myself every day to become a better web developer. Outside of development I am a writer, gamer, and all around general nerd.

		<br><br>Grab a cup of coffee and take a look at some of my recent work!</p>
